Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree Program

When I started this nanodegree I knew nothing about which are the tasks related to the role of a "data engineer". The aim of this project is to show what I learnt, and then, that what I do matchs the project rubric.

# What I learnt
## Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
## Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
## Step 3: Define the Data Model
## Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data 
## Step 5: Complete Project Write Up

# What I have done: rubric fullfilment

# What I learnt
## Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data

The scope of this project is to allow users identifying patterns over a high amount of data relating US inmigrating faster. They will access these data faster than they would do if they accessed them directly in the raw csv files. 

## Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
## Step 3: Define the Data Model
## Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data 
## Step 5: Complete Project Write Up
